Descriptionof the Task:

Credit Card Lead Prediction Happy Customer Bank is a mid-sized private bank that deals in all kinds of banking products, like Savings accounts, Current accounts, investment products, credit products, among other offerings.

The bank also cross-sells products to its existing customers and to do so they use different kinds of communication like tele-calling, e-mails, recommendations on net banking, mobile banking, etc.

In this case, the Happy Customer Bank wants to cross sell its credit cards to its existing customers. The bank has identified a set of customers that are eligible for taking these credit cards.

Now, the bank is looking for your help in identifying customers that could show higher intent towards a recommended credit card, given:

Customer details (gender, age, region etc.) Details of his/her relationship with the bank (Channel_Code,Vintage, 'Avg_Asset_Value etc.)
